## About

Social Circle is a web application that allows users to connect with friends remotely and engage in custom quizzes and games.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this creation arose from the cherished moments spent with my friends, particularly during the challenging times of the COVID pandemic, where connecting remotely became our norm. Despite the distance, we gathered virtually at night, engaging in banter and games, almost as if we were all in the same room. Two of our treasured games, custom quizzes created by some of us and Cards Against Humanity, are proudly featured on the site. To enhance the user experience, this web app boasts a comprehensive authentication system encompassing registration, email activation, login, and password reset functionalities. Upon login, users are redirected to a personalized dashboard where they can indulge in quizzes (with Cards Against Humanity currently in development). They are also able to see and edit their profile information. In the quizzes section, users can create their own quizzes, which become accessible and playable for all users. Following a quiz, players are redirected to a results page, where they can view their scores and even review correct answers. The site is currently live, and as time progresses, I intend to enrich it further with additional features, catering to friends within our social circle who may not be geographically close, so we can maintain our cherished connections, just as we did before.
